As I learn unknown vocabularies from time to time
I stretch my arm towards the vestige
But perhaps I am the only person who doesn't know that words

Goodbye is bitter
"I love you" has a far-off smell has
They are incomparable
This feeling is very frightening but very lovely

I wonder why I am crying
What should I answer in my mind?
Despite I cannot say whenever without a word
That feelings are always there, keeps growing
I find myself wanting to see you

As I learn beautiful words from time to time
It is somewhat Iâ€™m going to hate myself
But perhaps I should not escape from the words

Sadness is cold
"Thank you" turns color into warmth tone
Every time I touch the thing that has no form
Your voice is echoing deep within my chest

When it comes to write I stopped
A letter with no address
Flutters in the wind
To the city of the person that I wish to deliver
In order to convey the end of a beginning

For living on, for not stopping
Wish you are proud of today

I wonder why I am crying
What should I answer in my mind?
Despite I cannot say whenever without a word
That feelings are always there, keeps growing
I find myself wanting to see you!
